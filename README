Scripts for creating PirateBox Images via OpenWRT's ImageBuilder

make all 

or

make imagebuilder
make MR3020 


The imagebuilder refers to the first PirateBox-OpenWRT-Packagerepository under: 
http://stable.openwrt.piratebox.de/all/packages/

During customization, the package pbxopg gets installed. This package is located at the 
repository above and modifies opkg.conf at the final image to use that repository too.


See our repository for that too: https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/openwrt-temp-repository
